Change your source generator so this project compiles and runs successfully.
Use the generator's Initialize method to register a callback for after the initialization.
This callback should add some source code to the compilation.
The source code that should be added is a class called Mapper in the namespace AotMapper:
namespace AotMapper
{
    public class Mapper
    {
    }
}
