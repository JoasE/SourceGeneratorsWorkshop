Change your source generator so this project compiles and runs successfully.

Replace the code you added to the compilation in the Source Generator's Initialize method with this partial class definition:
public partial class Mapper
{
    public partial TDestination Map<TSource, TDestination>(TSource source)
        where TDestination : class, new();
}

Use the generator's Execute method to add more code on compile time
Add this empty implementation of the partial class:
public partial class Mapper
{
    public partial TDestination Map<TSource, TDestination>(TSource source)
        where TDestination : class, new()
    {
        return new TDestination();
    }

    {YOUR CODE HERE}

}

And add a method for every call to mapper.Map<TSource, TDestination>() which accepts the source and destination as parameters.
You should do this by looking through the compilations expression trees and adding the code dynamically using a StringBuilder.

Your produced source should look like this after your source generator is done running.

public partial class Mapper
{
    public partial TDestination Map<TSource, TDestination>(TSource source)
        where TDestination : class, new()
    {
        return new TDestination();
    }

    public void Map(SourceGeneratorsWorkshop.Opdracht2.Model s, SourceGeneratorsWorkshop.Opdracht2.Dto d)
    {
    }
}
